**Restock Rocket** allows you to set a site-wide minimum stock threshold above which automatic back in stock alerts are sent to customers for their requested product. The default minimum stock limit to trigger the alert is set as 1 for all products in your store.

To set a minimum stock threshold, please go to **Settings** and under "Email Settings", set the minimum quantity you wish above which automatic back in stock alerts are to be sent to your customers and save your changes.
