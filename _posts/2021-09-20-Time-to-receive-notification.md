**Restock Rocket** sends notifications to your customers immediately when the product and variant they requested is restocked or when the inventory level of the product and variant meets the minimum stock threshold you have set in the App.

If you believe that your customers are not being sent email notifications even after updating your inventory, please reach out to us for support at <a href="mailto:support@restockrocket.io">support@restockrocket.io</a>.
