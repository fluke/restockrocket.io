**Restock Rocket** sends your customers email notifications automatically for a product variant once the inventory quantity is updated from 0 to 1 unit or more.

If you have set up a minimum stock threshold to send back in stock emails to your customers, **Restock Rocket** will only send emails to your customers automatically once the inventory quantity has reached the minimum stock threshold you have defined in your **Settings** under "Email settings".
