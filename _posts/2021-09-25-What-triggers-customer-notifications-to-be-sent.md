**Restock Rocket** sends your customers email notifications automatically for a product variant once the inventory quantity is updated from 0 to 1 unit or more.

If you have set up a minimum stock threshold to send back in stock emails to your customers, **Restock Rocket** will only send emails to your customers automatically once the inventory quantity has reached the minimum stock threshold you have defined in your **Settings** under "Email settings".

**Note:** Back in stock email notifications are only sent for products and variants that have been published.

If you believe that your customers are not being sent email notifications even after updating your inventory, please reach out to us for support at **support@restockrocket.io**.
