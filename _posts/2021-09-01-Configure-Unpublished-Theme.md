**Restock Rocket** only supports published themes at the moment. Once you have published your theme, the button will be automatically displayed on your product pages when the product is out of stock.

If you don’t see the “Email me when available” button pop up on out of stock products on your store, please reach out to us for support at **support@restockrocket.io**.

We highly value your feedback and are committed to providing you with the tools you need to grow your e-commerce business. If you believe this is a critical feature for your business, please use our “Request a Feature” tab to provide us with the feedback.
