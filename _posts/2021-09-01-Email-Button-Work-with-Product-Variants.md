Yes, **Restock Rocket** works with all product variants. The app automatically identifies the products and variants that are out of stock and only shows the “Email me when Available” button on the variants that are out of stock.

We also enable your customers to choose from the out of stock variants from a drop-down menu in the sign up form once they click the “Email me when available” button. The drop-down menu automatically only shows the variants that are out of stock.
