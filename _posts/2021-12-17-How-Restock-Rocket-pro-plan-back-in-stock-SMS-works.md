Back in Stock SMS alerts achieve a 3x better conversion rate than traditional email alerts. Restock Rocket's Pro plan allows you to send UNLIMITED email alerts and UNLIMITED SMS alerts too, starting at $0.1 per SMS sent. The Pro plan also entitles you to priority support and access to all new features that will be released.

For example - If you signed up to Restock Rocket's PRO plan on Dec 12, then your billing cycles will be Dec 12 - Jan 11, Jan 12 - Feb 11 and so on. Let's say you had 100 SMS notifications from Dec 12 - Jan 11 sent to customers in USA/CA, you will be charged $10 ($0.1 X 100) in the same billing cycle in addition to the $20 subscription charge. If no SMS's are sent in a particular month, you will not be charged.

At Restock Rocket, I am dedicated to helping you succeed with your business. If you are not sure about the usage fee charged to your store or if you feel that you have been charged incorrectly, please let me know via the Customer Support widget within Restock Rocket or via email at <a href="mailto:support@restockrocket.io">support@restockrocket.io</a>. Rest assured that if there is any issue on my part, I'll make sure to issue a refund at the earliest.

SMS charges vary depending on the country your customers are located in.
