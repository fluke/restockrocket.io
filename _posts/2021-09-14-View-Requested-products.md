**Restock Rocket** creates insightful reports for you to keep a track of products and variants that your customers have requested.

To view the out of stock products that have been requested, please go to the "Products" Tab. Here you will be able to see the Product Name, Number of times it has been requested and the last request date. We automatically sort the list so you can see the products that have been most requested first.
