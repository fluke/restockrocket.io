To disable the app, please go to **Settings** and under "Enable/Disable", click the **deactivate** button. Once the app is deactivated, **Restock Rocket** will not allow your customers to register for notifications and will not send any emails when a product is back in stock.

If you face any trouble deactivating the app, please reach out to us for support at **support@restockrocket.io**.
