As of now, **Restock Rocket** sends automatic emails to your customers only from **alerts@restockrocket.com**. However, all replies to any email from our app will go to the email address mentioned in the “Reply-to address” field in the **Design -> Email Template** tab.

From the **Design -> Email Template** tab, you can also change the “From Name” to the name you would like your customers to receive emails from.

After changing your “Reply-to-address” and “From Name”, you can save changes and send a test email to ensure the changes have been published.
