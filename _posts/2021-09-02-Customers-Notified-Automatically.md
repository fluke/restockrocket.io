Yes, **Restock Rocket** automatically sends emails to your customers who have signed up for back in stock notifications once their requested product has been restocked.

There are two ways to monitor the email notifications that have been sent to your customers:
1.	On the "Dashboard" of the app, you can see the number of notifications sent which will be reported as “Notifications Sent”
2.	In the "Reports -> Notifications" Tab, you can see the customer email, product name, and date sent when you filter for “Sent” notifications.

If emails notifications are not being automatically sent to your customers when their requested out of stock products are back in stock, please reach out to us for support at **support@restockrocket.io**.
