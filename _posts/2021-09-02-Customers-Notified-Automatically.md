Yes, **Restock Rocket** automatically sends emails to your customers who have signed up for back in stock notifications once their requested product has been restocked.

 To monitor the email notifications that have been sent to your customers, go to the "Dashboard" of the app, you can see the number of notifications sent which will be reported as “Notifications Sent”. From here you can also the number of orders and revenue generated by Restock Rocket.
