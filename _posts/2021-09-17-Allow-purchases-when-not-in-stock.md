**Restock Rocket** will not publish any "Email me when available" buttons on your store and will not allow customers to sign up for back in stock alerts for products that are set to “Continue selling when out of stock”.

If you see the "Email me when available" buttons on products which are set to “Continue selling when out of stock”, please reach out to us for support at <a href="mailto:support@restockrocket.io">support@restockrocket.io</a>.
