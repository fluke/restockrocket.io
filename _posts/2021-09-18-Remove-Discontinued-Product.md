You do not need to do anything to remove a discontinued product from **Restock Rocket**. Since the product is no longer available to purchase for your customers and will not be restocked, the app will not send email notifications to customers.

For more details, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@restockrocket.io">support@restockrocket.io</a>.
